Hello Dr.,

    I came across this head from an ancient first-gen robot during a 
recent research excursion to the pole. We were tunneling deep into the 
permafrost where we found this guy. We collected it into the borer and when we
got back to base, I plugged it in. Luckily some of the equipment is pretty old
so we had the cable on hand. I didn't expect much but to my amazement, my 
encephalometer picked up a signal (and not just from my huge noggin ;-P)! I 
guess something about the cold kept it intact and functional all these years.
To think, it comes from before the dark times. It must have been a patrol
during the war back when there was no ice left and then it lost charge and got
buried when the cold winters returned. We were just ideas back then haha!

    Anyway, it was going to be junk anyway, but it seems like your kind of
junk. Hopefully it can help you with your robot dream experiments. Maybe
it's a good first subject for that new wave probing program you made? 
Excited to see what you do with it!

Your friend,
- Dr. Pplope
